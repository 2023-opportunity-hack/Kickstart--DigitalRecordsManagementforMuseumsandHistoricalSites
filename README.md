# Kickstart - Heritage Hub

## Problem Statement
[Digital Records Management for Museums and Historical Sites](https://ohack.dev/project/nIzOXqfvqwa03WPjr08a)

## A Small Introduction

Heritage Hub System is a robust solution for organizing and making searchable a vast collection of historical files, including text documents, images, audio recordings, and more. This system is designed to meet the needs of Preservation Partners of the Fox Valley in efficiently managing their archives, preserving historical records, and enabling easy research access.

## Technologies Used

| Purpose  | Technologies Used | 
|----------|----------|
| Preprocessing Files | Java, Spring Boot | 
| MetaData API, Machine Learning Models | Python | 
| FilePath Storage | Elastic Search |

## Why Our Solution is Better Than Others

- **Cost-Effective**: We don't store files anywhere, which means there are no storage costs. Only file paths are stored, reducing operational expenses.

- **Faster Processing**: Leveraging concurrent programming, our system can process files efficiently, reducing wait times for users.

- **Local Storage**: Everything is locally stored, eliminating the need for complex cloud infrastructure setup. It ensures the system can run offline without an internet connection.

- **Lightweight**: Our application is lightweight, ensuring it runs smoothly even on modest hardware.

- **Enhanced Security**: Files are not exposed in any cloud storage, ensuring the security and privacy of historical records.

- **Legacy File Support**: Our system supports file formats from the 1980s, including .RTF files, which may not be supported by current ML models.

## Rest APIs Exposed

Our system exposes the following RESTful APIs:

- **Search**: Allows users to search for historical records using various search criteria.
- **Update File Path**: Enables the updating of file paths in the system.
- **Get Metadata**: Retrieves metadata associated with historical records.

## Steps to Setup and Run the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Configure the system by updating the necessary settings.
4. Start the application.
5. Access the user interface or interact with the REST APIs.

Detailed setup instructions can be found in the [Setup Guide](link-to-setup-guide).

## Future Enhancements and Scope

We have plans to enhance the system with the following features:

- Improved user interface for a seamless user experience.
- Integration with existing systems like Past Perfect for seamless data migration.
- Enhanced file format support and more advanced metadata extraction techniques.
- User feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

Your feedback and contributions are welcome to help us expand the capabilities of this archive management system.
